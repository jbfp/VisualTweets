VisualTweets
============

Shows tweets from a Twitter keyword search in a flashy manner. Take a look at https://chromesthesia.azurewebsites.net/
I guess Chromesthesia is the working title but there doesn't seem to be many colours about it yet.

After authorizing with Twitter, add a relative path with your query, e.g. https://chromesthesia.azurewebsites.net/%23autumn for searching for "#autumn" (there are some lovely photos to be found.)
